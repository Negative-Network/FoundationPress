# FoundationPress + Unyson Framework

This project aims to include the [Unyson Framework](http://unyson.themefuse.com/) within the [FoundationPress](https://github.com/olefredrik/FoundationPress) theme in order to
offer an easy-to-use and easy-to-develop backoffice solution.

At this time our first goal is to adapt the layout builder for Foundation and offer some basic elements : Text block, image, video, widget-area and sliders

As a side note, we personnally aim to use this in combination with the [Trickster FoundationPress child theme](https://github.com/thetrickster/FoundationPress-child)

Please fork and make pull request if you'd like to contribute!


# FoundationPress

This is a WordPress starter theme based on Foundation 5 by Zurb. The purpose of FoundationPress, is to act as a small and handy toolbox that contains the essentials needed to build any design. FoundationPress is meant to be a starting point, not the final product. If you're looking for an all-in-one theme with built-in shortcodes, plugins, fancypancy portfolio templates or whatnot, I'm afraid you have to look elsewhere.

To get started with FoundationPress, check the [FoundationPress](https://github.com/olefredrik/FoundationPress) page
